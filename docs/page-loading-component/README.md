# Page Loading Component

This component provides users with a visual indicator when the application is loading a page. It displays a loading bar at the top of the screen and a TDC logo with three animated loading dots in the bottom-right corner. The purpose is to enhance user experience by offering a clear and aesthetic way of communicating page loading status.

### Key Features:

1. **Loading Bar**: A progress bar that moves from left to right, located at the top of the page, indicating page load progress.
2. **TDC Icon with Loading Dots**: In the bottom-right corner, the TDC logo appears with three animated dots to represent ongoing activity. The dots pulse sequentially to visually suggest loading.
3. **Dynamic Loading Detection**: The component listens to page routing events (`routeChangeStart`, `routeChangeComplete`, and `routeChangeError`) and updates the loading state accordingly, using a timer to show a loader only if the loading process takes longer than a set threshold.
4. **Smooth Animations**: The entire loading component features a fade-in animation to make the transition smooth, improving the visual appeal.
